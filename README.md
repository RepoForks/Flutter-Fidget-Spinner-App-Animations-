# Flutter SDK - Fidget Spinner Application (Animation preview)

This project was created to test animations with Flutter SDK. The result is a Fidget spinner application!

## Application Preview
*This animation will be 60 fps on devices. This gif has a reduced framerate to reduce image size!*
### The second tab now has a fidget spinner that will spin when you slide your finger over the screen!
